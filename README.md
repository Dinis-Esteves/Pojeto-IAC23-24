# Projeto-IAC23-24

## Project Overview
Welcome to our repository where we showcase our project for the course "Introduction to Computer Architecture". This project is a collaborative effort by a team of three students to implement the kMeans clustering algorithm using 32-bit RISC-V assembly language.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with low-level programming and to understand the intricacies of computer architecture. By implementing the kMeans algorithm in assembly, we aimed to optimize performance and efficiency on a granular level.

## Implementation
The kMeans algorithm was meticulously coded in RISC-V assembly, ensuring that each instruction was carefully crafted to utilize the capabilities of the 32-bit architecture. Our implementation focuses on:
- Efficient memory management
- Precise register allocation
- Minimization of computational overhead

## Team Members
- Tiago Fernandes
- Dinis Esteves
- Ana Caldeira

## Usage
To run the kMeans algorithm on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a RISC-V compatible simulator or environment set up (We Used Ripes).
3. Open a Led Matrix (32x32)

## Results
Our implementation successfully clusters data points into k groups with remarkable accuracy and speed. The results demonstrate the potential of assembly language in executing algorithms that require high performance.
